# OCCII Analog TV Visualizer

This repository contains all the code that is loaded into the Raspberry Pi connected to an analog TV at OCCII.

This project is mostly based on the amazing [Earthbound Background Generator](https://www.gjtorikian.com/Earthbound-Battle-Backgrounds-JS/), with some text overlayed to write down band names and other information. Full credit to the original developers (and Nintendo and all other parties listed in the original repository).
